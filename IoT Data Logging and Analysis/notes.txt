 IoT Data Logging & Analysis

    Concept: Create a database for storing data from IoT devices, analyze sensor data over time, and visualize trends.

    Key Features:

        Sensor data storage (temperature, humidity, etc.).

        Time-based data analysis (e.g., trend analysis, anomaly detection).

        Integration with visualization tools (like Tableau, or use pg_stat_statements for optimization).

    SQL Techniques: Time-series data management, date_trunc, PARTITION BY, window functions, and data integrity.
